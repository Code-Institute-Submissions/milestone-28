# Milestone project 1 - "Edenderry Swimming Pool"

Swimming pool is situated in my local comnunity in Edenderry.
The web page that was avalable at the start of the project was 10 years old and impossible to view on smartphones. (the origianl webpage is under construction now and being updated)
I choose it as my subject with intention of bringing in my contribution to community by delivering free of charge update.


## UX

Website is adressed to local community swimming pool. Project focus is on providing information about timetable, location and service prices of the local swimming pool ,
in a simple reponsive and acceseble UX interface.

The best way to achive it is to build an intuitive and familiar layot of the page that can be navigated without any setbacks.

As a user main information interest me a an user on a swimming pool presentation page are location/services/timetable/price.
Goal is to give user information he need a click away.
Action is to place relevant links on main page so they are easy to reach.


First mockups for the base design and structure :

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

    - The project uses schedule template as timetable to make information about opening hours and services easier to read.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
